# SQL VIEWS

# 1) Explain what is the difference between a view and a table? Especially what are the benefits of using a view? what are the downsides?


# 2) Connect to the database you created in "sql_relations"

import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('learn_area/test_database.db')

# 3) Create a VIEW (the view name  should start with "VIEW_") which contains a JOIN of the 2 tables "GAME_OF_THRONES_HOUSES" and "GAME_OF_THRONES_CHARACTERS" and any WHERE condition.





# 4) Create another VIEW of your choice

# 5) Now Query both of the VIEWs
