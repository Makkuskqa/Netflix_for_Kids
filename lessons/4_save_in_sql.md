# Save data in SQL

You already know how to save a table in a SQL database. Now we want to add some more knowledge about SQL tables.

One of the big benefits of a SQL database is that it is a "relational" database. What does that mean? 
It means that it is very good, to define relations between different tables. This can give the user a better understanding how all the data is related. And it also makes the process of searching or changing data much more efficient.
